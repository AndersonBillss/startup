## AWS Notes

I have my site deployed with AWS

## HTML Notes

Added four plain HTML pages that show the structure of my startup application. I used correct elements to display information and I 
put placeholders for API information, database information, and websocket information.

## CSS Notes

I had a lot of fun using CSS. I take full advantage of the power of Flexbox and I use custom properties to keep my styling consistent. I also added hover effects to buttons, making them appear darker and setting the cursor to a pointer. I used media rules to adjust the website for several different screen sizes. I love styling websites and I can see how powerful flex is.
