## AWS Notes

I have my site deployed with AWS

## HTML Notes

Added four plain HTML pages that show the structure of my startup application. I used correct elements to display information and I 
put placeholders for API information, database information, and websocket information.

## CSS Notes

I had a lot of fun using CSS. I take full advantage of the power of Flexbox and I use custom properties to keep my styling consistent. I also added hover effects to buttons, making them appear darker and setting the cursor to a pointer. I used media rules to adjust the website for several different screen sizes. I love styling websites and I can see how powerful flex is.

## React Part 1 Notes

Adding React to my project was straightforward. I like that I can reuse and import components so I don't have to duplicate HTML like when I had to in the HTML deliverable. This feels much more structured. It also got me ready to add JavaScript to my application.

## React Part 2 Notes

I had a lot of fun with this part. State is a difficult concept but I feel like I have mastered it. In addition to useState and useEffect, I used React's Context API to share important state between my pages. I mocked all of the services which required me to think about how I want these services to work. Although working with React was difficult, I can't wait to get started on the server!

## Service Notes

It's super cool to have a service connecting players. I feel like I really improved my skills in designing APIs. The hardest part about creating the API was verification. I have never used cookies for verification; I usually just use localstorage. But I actually found this method very simple once I figured it out. Now that my server is hosted, I can finally test it out with other people!

## DB Notes

This was an easier deliverable. I seperated functions that access/manipulate data into a seperate file. From there, it was just a matter of replacing functions with database versions one by one. It is really cool to be able to persist data like this because it will allow me to roll out updates without resetting user data.

## WebSocket Notes

It feels really good to have my application working seamlessly. Working on the WebSocket was very rewarding! And due to earlier planning, it was fairly straightforward to implement. Most of the work involved hosting the WebSocket on the server side, notifying other clients when their data changes. I am really happy to see all parts of my application working together well!
