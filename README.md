[My Notes](notes.md)

WarLab is an ultra competetive game where players compete to see who can beat each other. 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever gotten into an argument where you are correct and everyone else is wrong? There is now a solution. WarLab is a free, hands on experience designed to allow users to compete with each other in a meaningful way. This interactive platform allows users to practice wartime strategies and create intricate strategies to ultimately become the victor. This platform provides a method to resolve conflicts and more importantly allows us to find the supreme leader of Earth

### Design

![Design image](Attack_Page.png)

WarLab is a strategy game about spending your soldiers wisely and clicking very fast.

When a user creates an account, they will be given a fixed number of soldiers as their total life. 

On the landing page, users will be able to see their current number of troops as well as tasks that allow them to build up their army.

On the attack page, users can spend some of their troops to eliminate other players
